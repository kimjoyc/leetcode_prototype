# Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms: A Guided LeetCode Curriculum

Welcome to your personalized guide for mastering data structures and algorithms.  
This is not just another problem bank ‚Äî it's a guided curriculum built to teach you **core concepts**, build intuition, and help you understand _why_ and _how_ solutions work.

## üìö How to Use This Guide

- **Focus on Concepts First:** Each topic begins with a gentle introduction, visual explanations, and simple examples.
- **Solve in Depth:** Start with simple problems to internalize concepts, then gradually increase difficulty to reinforce and extend your understanding.
- **Track Your Progress:** Mark off completed sections and revisit ones that need review as you build mastery.
